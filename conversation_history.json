This is why image generation isn't working.\n\n**Fix:**\n1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey\n2. Click \"Create API Key\" to generate a new key\n3. Update your `/Users/richardechols/Apps/.env.local` with the new key\n4. Update Nano Banana Studio's hardcoded key (or remove it and use env var)\n\nThe code implementation is correct - it's just the API key that's blocked. Once you have a fresh key, the image generation with `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` or `gemini-2.5-flash-image` will work.\n\nThe correct API format (verified from your Nano Banana Studio and Google docs):\n```python\nfrom google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=YOUR_API_KEY)\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-3-pro-image-preview\",  # or gemini-2.5-flash-image\n    contents=\"Your prompt here\",\n    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n        response_modalities=[\"IMAGE\", \"TEXT\"],\n        image_config=types.ImageConfig(\n            aspect_ratio=\"16:9\"  # or 1:1, 9:16, etc.\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\nSources:\n- [Gemini Image Generation API Docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation)\n- [Gemini Models Overview](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)",
