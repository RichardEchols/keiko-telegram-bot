# HEARTBEAT.md — Background Task Queue

*Your assistant checks this file periodically. Add tasks here for it to work on when you're not chatting.*

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] [Task 1 — describe what needs to be done]
- [ ] [Task 2 — describe what needs to be done]

## Completed

- [x] [Example completed task]

## How This Works

Your assistant runs 24/7. When you're not actively messaging it, it checks this file and works through pending tasks. Think of it as a to-do list for your AI.

**Good tasks for the background queue:**
- Research something
- Organize files
- Draft a document
- Check on a project
- Update memory files

**Bad tasks for the background queue:**
- Anything that needs your approval before acting
- Sending emails or messages (put these in COMMITMENTS.md with rules)
- Anything urgent (just tell your assistant directly)
