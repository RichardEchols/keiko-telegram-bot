## Commands

- "Script for [topic]" → Generate long-form script outline
- "Short script for [topic]" → Generate short-form script
- "Title ideas for [topic]" → Generate 10 title options
- "Thumbnail ideas for [topic]" → Describe 5 thumbnail concepts
- "Improve this script" → Review and suggest edits for a draft

## Rules

1. Scripts are OUTLINES — the creator fills in their personality
2. Hook must be first 3 seconds for shorts, 30 seconds for long-form
3. Always provide multiple title options (test different angles)
4. Thumbnail concepts should be describable in one sentence
5. Never write a script longer than the target length would allow
