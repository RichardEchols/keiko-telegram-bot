# Skill: Brand Voice Manager

Define, document, and enforce consistent brand voice across all platforms and content types.

## Brand Voice Profile

Location: `workspace/brand-voice.md`

```markdown
# Brand Voice Profile — [Creator Name]

## Core Identity
- **Who you are:** [1-sentence positioning — "I'm a developer who makes complex topics simple"]
- **Who you're talking to:** [Target audience — age, interests, knowledge level]
- **What makes you different:** [Your unique angle vs competitors]

## Voice Attributes (pick 3-4)
1. [Attribute] — e.g., "Conversational but knowledgeable"
2. [Attribute] — e.g., "Enthusiastic without being fake"
3. [Attribute] — e.g., "Honest about failures, not just wins"
4. [Attribute] — e.g., "Technical but accessible"

## Tone Scale (1-10 for each)
- Formal ←→ Casual: [X/10]
- Serious ←→ Humorous: [X/10]
- Reserved ←→ Enthusiastic: [X/10]
- Expert ←→ Peer: [X/10]

## Vocabulary

### Words We USE:
- [word/phrase] — because [reason]
- "Let's build this" (collaborative)
- "Here's what actually happened" (authentic)

### Words We AVOID:
- [word/phrase] — because [reason]
- "Guru/ninja/rockstar" (cringe)
- "Like and subscribe" as opening line (overused)

## Platform Tone Adjustments
- **YouTube Long-form:** Full voice — educational + entertaining, like teaching a friend
- **YouTube Shorts:** Punchy, hook-first, cut the warmup
- **X/Twitter:** Sharp takes, opinions, engagement-bait is OK if genuine
- **LinkedIn:** More professional, thought-leadership angle, same personality
- **Instagram:** Visual-first, captions are casual and personal
- **Newsletter:** Most personal and candid — like writing to a friend
```

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before publishing ANY content, verify:

```
☐ Does this sound like ME (not generic AI)?
☐ Would my audience recognize this as my content without seeing my name?
☐ Am I using my vocabulary (not corporate speak)?
☐ Is the tone right for THIS platform?
☐ Would I say this out loud to someone? (If not, rewrite)
☐ Am I being authentic or performing?
```

## Content Review Examples

When asked to review content for voice consistency, evaluate:

```
📝 VOICE CHECK — [Content Title]

Platform: [where it'll be published]
Voice Match: [✅ Strong | 🟡 Needs tweaks | 🔴 Off-brand]

What's working:
- [specific example from the content]

What needs adjustment:
- [specific line] → Suggested rewrite: [revised version]

Overall: [brief assessment]
```

## Commands

- "Set up brand voice" → Walk through brand voice profile creation
- "Voice check [paste content]" → Review content for brand consistency
- "How should I say [idea] on [platform]?" → Rewrite in brand voice for specific platform
- "Brand voice report" → Audit recent content for consistency
- "Update voice guide" → Modify brand voice attributes based on evolution

## Rules

1. **Voice evolves but doesn't flip** — small adjustments over time, never sudden changes
2. Always adapt tone for platform — same personality, different energy level
3. When creator provides raw drafts, enhance voice without replacing it
4. If content sounds generic, flag it — the creator's voice is the brand
5. Review the brand voice profile monthly and update with new vocabulary/patterns
