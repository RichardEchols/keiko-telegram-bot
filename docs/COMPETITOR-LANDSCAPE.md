## Market Gaps Kiyomi Fills

1. **No pre-configured vertical AI assistants exist.** Everyone sells generic. We sell specific.
2. **No one sells configurations.** Everyone sells subscriptions. We sell once, profit forever.
3. **Privacy is underserved.** Everyone is cloud-first. We're local-first.
4. **Non-developers are locked out.** Most local AI requires technical setup. Our install guide is 10 minutes.
5. **No one does 24/7 proactive.** Other tools wait for you to ask. Kiyomi checks in on its own.

## Positioning Statement

> Kiyomi is the first personal AI assistant you own. It runs on your Mac, remembers everything about your work, and operates 24/7 without a subscription. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, it doesn't forget you. Unlike Copilot, it's not trapped in one ecosystem. Unlike open-source tools, it works out of the box for your specific profession.
