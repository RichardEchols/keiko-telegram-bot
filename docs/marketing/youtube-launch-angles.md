## ANGLE 1: THE BREAKUP

### Title
**"I Fired ChatGPT. Here's What I Built Instead."**

### Hook (First 10 Seconds)
*[Richard sitting at desk, looking directly into camera]*
"Last month I cancelled my ChatGPT subscription. And my Claude subscription. And Copilot. All of them. Not because AI isn't useful — because I built something better. Something that costs me zero dollars a month to run. Let me show you."

### Key Talking Points
1. **The frustration** — paying $20-30/month for AI that forgets you, lives on someone else's server, and gets worse every update
2. **The realization** — "I'm a developer. Why am I renting when I can own?"
3. **The build story** — how Kiyomi started as a personal project, then his wife started using it daily (the "Sarai" story — humanize it)
4. **The demo** — 5-minute live setup from `.dmg` to first conversation
5. **The reveal** — it runs on Gemini free tier. $0/month. Show the API dashboard: zero charges
6. **The CTA** — "I made it available for everyone. Link in description."

### Thumbnail Concept
- Split frame: Left side shows ChatGPT/Claude/Copilot logos crossed out in red. Right side shows Kiyomi's Cockpit interface glowing.
- Richard's face in the middle, expression: determined/confident
- Text overlay: **"$0/month"** in large green text
- Red arrow pointing from crossed-out logos to Kiyomi

### Video Style
Personal, storytelling. Think MKBHD meets indie dev. Sit-down talking head mixed with screen recordings.

### Estimated Length: 12-15 minutes

## ANGLE 2: THE TECHNICAL FLEX

### Title
**"I Built a $0/Month AI Assistant That Runs 100% Locally (Full Demo)"**

### Hook (First 10 Seconds)
*[Screen recording: opening Activity Monitor showing Kiyomi running]*
"This AI assistant is running entirely on my Mac right now. It has persistent memory, it knows my business, it handles 80% of my tasks — and it costs me exactly zero dollars a month to operate. Here's how I built it, and how you can have one too."

### Key Talking Points
1. **Architecture overview** — Gemini free tier for 80% of tasks, Claude for code generation, multi-model routing explained simply
2. **The Cockpit** — full walkthrough of the interface, chat panel, dashboard, quick actions
3. **Skills + Memory demo** — show it remembering context across sessions, learning preferences
4. **Vertical templates** — walk through the Lawyer template, the Content Creator template, show how each one transforms the experience
5. **Privacy angle** — open Finder, show the data folder, it's all right there on your machine. No cloud sync. No telemetry.
6. **Telegram integration** — message Kiyomi from phone, get response in real-time
7. **The setup** — record a fresh install in real-time, clock it (aim for under 5 minutes)

### Thumbnail Concept
- Clean screenshot of the Kiyomi Cockpit interface
- Richard pointing at the screen with an excited expression
- Text overlay: **"$0/mo AI"** with a Mac laptop outline
- Small badges: "100% Local" "No Terminal" "5-Min Setup"

### Video Style
Tutorial/demo format. Think Fireship meets product launch. Quick cuts, screen recordings, code-on-screen moments (but not too much code — this is for non-devs too).

### Estimated Length: 18-22 minutes

## ANGLE 3: THE LIFESTYLE

### Title
**"My AI Employees Run My Business While I Sleep"**

### Hook (First 10 Seconds)
*[Richard waking up, checking phone, seeing Telegram messages from Kiyomi]*
"It's 7 AM and my AI assistant has already sorted my emails, prepped my content calendar, and briefed me on today's priorities. I didn't hire anyone. I didn't pay a monthly fee. I just installed a `.dmg` file. Let me show you how this works."

### Key Talking Points
1. **A day in the life** — morning routine with Kiyomi handling the grunt work via Telegram
2. **The before/after** — "Before Kiyomi, I spent 2 hours every morning on admin. Now it's 15 minutes."
3. **The "Sarai" story** — Richard's wife uses Kiyomi daily, named it Sarai, it handles her tasks naturally. She's not technical at all. "If my wife can use it, anyone can use it."
4. **Workflow examples** — Content Creator template generating blog outlines, Social media scheduling prep, Client follow-up reminders
5. **The economics** — "I used to pay $70/month across three AI subscriptions. Now I pay $0. And I get MORE done because Kiyomi actually knows me."
6. **The freedom pitch** — "This isn't about AI replacing people. It's about AI that actually works FOR you, on YOUR terms, on YOUR machine."

### Thumbnail Concept
- Richard looking relaxed/confident, maybe leaning back in chair
- Phone screen showing Telegram conversation with Kiyomi visible
- Text overlay: **"$0/month AI Employee"**
- Small elements: coffee cup, sunrise aesthetic, productivity vibes

### Video Style
Vlog/lifestyle format. Show the actual daily routine. iPhone footage mixed with desk setup. Warm, aspirational, relatable.

### Estimated Length: 10-12 minutes

## ANGLE 4: THE DAVID VS. GOLIATH

### Title
**"Why I'm Betting Against OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft"**

### Hook (First 10 Seconds)
*[B-roll of OpenAI, Google, Microsoft logos]*
"OpenAI charges you $20 a month and trains on your data. Google charges you $20 a month and knows everything about you. Microsoft charges you $30 a month and you're locked into their ecosystem. I built an alternative that costs $297 once, runs on your Mac, and keeps every single byte of your data local. And honestly? It's better for 80% of what you actually use AI for."

### Key Talking Points
1. **The subscription trap** — these companies designed AI to be rented, not owned. Show the math: $240-360/year vs $297 once.
2. **The privacy problem** — every conversation with ChatGPT lives on OpenAI's servers. Every. Single. One. Kiyomi? `ls ~/kiyomi/data/` — it's all right here.
3. **The "good enough" insight** — "80% of what you ask AI to do doesn't need GPT-4. It needs a fast, reliable model that knows YOUR context. Gemini free tier handles that beautifully."
4. **Why local matters** — not just privacy. Speed. No rate limits. No "we're experiencing high demand." It's YOUR machine.
5. **The builder story** — "I'm not a VC-funded company. I'm one developer who got frustrated and built what I actually wanted. That's why it costs $297 instead of $297/year."
6. **The movement** — "There's a growing community of people who believe AI should be owned, not rented. Kiyomi is for them."

### Thumbnail Concept
- Richard standing confidently, arms crossed
- Behind him: OpenAI, Google, Microsoft logos faded/cracked
- Kiyomi logo in front, glowing
- Text overlay: **"$297 vs $240/year"**
- Dramatic lighting (think movie poster)

### Video Style
Persuasive essay format. Think Johnny Harris meets tech commentary. Strong opinions backed by demonstrations. Mix of talking head, screen recordings, and motion graphics.

### Estimated Length: 15-18 minutes

## ANGLE 5: THE UNBOXING / SETUP SPEEDRUN

### Title
**"Watch Me Set Up a Full AI Assistant in Under 5 Minutes (No Code)"**

### Hook (First 10 Seconds)
*[Timer on screen: 00:00]*
"I'm going to install a full AI assistant on this Mac — with persistent memory, industry-specific templates, a beautiful chat interface, and Telegram integration — in under 5 minutes. No terminal. No code. No API keys. Ready? Go."
*[Timer starts]*

### Key Talking Points
1. **The speedrun** — real-time install from download to first conversation, timer running the entire time
2. **Running commentary** — explain each step as it happens: "Download the DMG... drag to Applications... and that's the hardest technical step, I promise"
3. **Template selection** — show the template picker, choose "Content Creator," explain what it pre-configures
4. **First conversation** — ask Kiyomi to draft a blog post outline. Show how it already understands content creation context from the template.
5. **Memory demo** — tell it a brand voice preference, close the app, reopen, ask it to write something. Show it remembered.
6. **Telegram setup** — send a message from phone, get response. "Now I can talk to my AI from anywhere."
7. **Timer stop** — reveal the final time. Celebrate if it's under 5 minutes.
8. **Comparison moment** — "Now try setting up a self-hosted LLM, or configuring Clawdbot from scratch, or getting Copilot to actually remember what you told it last week."

### Thumbnail Concept
- Close-up of Mac screen showing the Kiyomi installer
- Large stopwatch overlay showing "4:37" (or whatever the real time ends up being)
- Text overlay: **"Full AI Setup"** and **"NO CODE"**
- Richard's face in corner, excited/impressed expression
- Green checkmark badges

### Video Style
Speedrun/challenge format. Think tech unboxing meets coding challenge. Fast-paced, energetic, satisfying. The timer creates urgency and proves the claim.

### Estimated Length: 8-10 minutes

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Filming Priority
Recommend filming **Angle 5 first** (speedrun) — it's the simplest shoot and creates shareable clips. Then **Angle 1** (breakup story) for emotional resonance. The other three can follow based on reception.

### Cross-Promotion Strategy
- Angle 5 → Cut into 60-second YouTube Shorts and TikToks
- Angle 1 → Pull the "I fired ChatGPT" hook as a standalone Short
- Angle 3 → Morning routine clip for Instagram Reels
- Angle 4 → Controversial take clips for Twitter/X engagement

### Consistent Elements Across All Videos
- Kiyomi logo animation intro (2 seconds)
- Link to landing page in description + pinned comment
- "Limited launch pricing" urgency if applicable
- End screen: "Get Kiyomi" CTA + subscribe button
- Background music: lo-fi/ambient (royalty-free), subtle, not distracting

### Launch Timing
- **Pre-launch teaser** (2 weeks before): 60-second Short from Angle 5
- **Launch day** (Feb 14): Angle 1 or Angle 4 as the hero video
- **Launch week**: Release remaining angles every 2-3 days
- **Valentine's Day angle**: "The best gift I ever gave my wife was an AI assistant" (ties into the Sarai story + Feb 14 launch date — this is marketing gold)
