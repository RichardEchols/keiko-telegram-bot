## FAQ SECTION

### Q: Wait, $0/month for AI? How?
Kiyomi uses Google Gemini's free tier for 80% of tasks. Gemini handles conversations, writing, scheduling, analysis — the stuff you do every day. It's genuinely free, with generous rate limits. For the 20% of tasks that need more power (code generation, complex reasoning), Kiyomi Pro includes Claude integration — you'd use your own API key, and typical usage costs $3-8/month. Most users never need it.

### Q: What if Gemini's free tier goes away?
Google has maintained Gemini's free tier since launch, and it's core to their ecosystem strategy. But even in a worst case: Kiyomi is built on open architecture. If anything changes, we can route to other free or low-cost models. You're never locked into one provider.

### Q: Is this a subscription in disguise?
No. Read that again. $297 once. We don't store your credit card. There's no "auto-renew." There's no "cancel anytime" because there's nothing to cancel. You buy it like you buy a pair of headphones.

### Q: Can I really set this up in 5 minutes?
Yes. Download the `.dmg`. Drag to Applications. Open the Cockpit. Choose your template. You're done. If you get stuck, Pro and Agency plans include direct support from the founder. But you won't get stuck.

### Q: What about Windows/Linux?
Mac first. Windows and Linux versions are on the roadmap for 2026. Join the waitlist and we'll notify you.

### Q: What's the refund policy?
14-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. If Kiyomi isn't for you, email us and you'll get a full refund. We're that confident.
