## HERO SECTION

### Headline
# You don't need another app. You need an assistant.

### Subheadline
Kiyomi is a personal AI that lives on your Mac — not in someone else's cloud. One purchase. Zero monthly fees. Your data never leaves your machine.

### CTA
**[Get Kiyomi — $297 Once, Yours Forever]**

*No subscription. No credit card on file. No "we'll charge you next month." Ever.*

> Design note: Hero background — slow-motion animation of the Cockpit interface, showing the chat panel and dashboard. Subtle particle effect in the background. The CTA button pulses gently once every 8 seconds.

## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM

### Pre-headline
*You're paying rent on your own intelligence.*

### Headline
# $20 a month. $30 a month. $240 a year. For what?

### Body
Every AI tool today works the same way. You pay monthly. Your conversations live on their servers. They change the pricing whenever they want. They throttle you when you use it "too much."

You don't own anything. You're renting access to a brain that forgets you every time the session ends.

**What if your AI actually knew you?**

What if it remembered your writing style, your clients' names, your preferences — and kept all of it locked inside your own machine?

What if it cost you nothing to run. Every single month. Forever.

> Design note: This section uses a slow counter animation showing "$20/mo" ticking up to "$240/year" → "$480 in 2 years" → "$720 in 3 years" while Kiyomi stays fixed at "$297. Total."

## SECTION 2: THE PRODUCT

### Pre-headline
*Meet Kiyomi.*

### Headline
# A real AI assistant. Not a chatbot with a subscription.

### Body
Kiyomi installs in 5 minutes. Download the `.dmg`. Drag to Applications. Answer 3 questions about what you do. That's it.

No terminal. No API keys. No configuration files. No Stack Overflow rabbit holes.

Just open the Cockpit and start talking to an AI that's already configured for your world.

> Design note: Full-width screenshot of the Cockpit app — the chat panel on the left, the dashboard on the right showing quick action buttons, and the beautiful dark-mode UI. Annotated with minimal callouts.

## SECTION 3: FEATURES (Card Grid)

### Card 1 — Zero Monthly Cost
#### $0/month. Not a typo.
Kiyomi uses Gemini's free tier for 80% of tasks. The AI that answers your questions, writes your emails, and manages your schedule doesn't cost you a dime to run. Month after month after month.

### Card 2 — Your Data Stays Home
#### 100% local. 100% yours.
Every conversation, every memory, every file — stored on YOUR Mac. Not on a server in Virginia. Not in a training dataset. Not in a breach notification email. On. Your. Machine.

### Card 3 — It Remembers You
#### Skills + Memory that persist forever.
Tell Kiyomi your brand voice once. It remembers. Tell it your client list. It remembers. Tell it you hate Oxford commas. It remembers. This isn't a chatbot that resets every session — it's an assistant that learns.

### Card 4 — Beautiful Cockpit Interface
#### Designed for humans, not hackers.
A stunning chat panel. A dashboard with your metrics. Quick action buttons for the things you do daily. Built with the same technology that powers Netflix and Notion. You'll never see a terminal. Promise.

### Card 5 — Templates for YOUR Industry
#### Pre-configured for how you actually work.
Choose your template at setup: Lawyer. Content Creator. Small Business Owner. Realtor. Coach. Kiyomi arrives knowing your industry's language, workflows, and needs. Customize from there.

### Card 6 — Talk to It Anywhere
#### Telegram-native messaging.
Message Kiyomi from your phone, your tablet, your watch. It's connected through Telegram — the same app you already use. No new apps to install. No portals to bookmark.

> Design note: 3x2 grid of cards with subtle hover animations. Each card has a custom icon in a muted accent color. Cards have a glass-morphism effect on hover.

## SECTION 6: THE MATH

### Pre-headline
*Let's talk about money.*

### Headline
# One year of ChatGPT costs $240. One year of Kiyomi costs $0.

### Body
Buy Kiyomi once for $297. Use it for a year, two years, five years, forever. The AI runs on Gemini's free tier — 80% of everything you need, at zero cost.

By month 13, you're already saving money compared to ChatGPT. By month 16, you're beating Claude Pro. By year two, you've saved hundreds. By year three, over a thousand.

**Your AI should be an asset, not an expense.**

> Design note: Animated comparison chart showing cost over time. Competitor lines slope upward. Kiyomi is a flat horizontal line at $297. The crossover points are highlighted with subtle callouts.
