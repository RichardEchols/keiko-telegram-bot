## DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### 💰 Price & Total Cost of Ownership

| | **Kiyomi Pro** | **ChatGPT Plus** | **Claude Pro** | **Microsoft Copilot** | **Clawdbot** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upfront Cost | $297 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| Monthly Subscription | **$0** | $20 | $20 | $30 | $0 |
| Monthly AI/API Costs | **$0** | Included | Included | Included | $5-50+ (varies) |
| Year 1 | **$297** | $240 | $240 | $360 | $60-600+ |
| Year 2 | **$297** | $480 | $480 | $720 | $120-1,200+ |
| Year 3 | **$297** | $720 | $720 | $1,080 | $180-1,800+ |
| Year 5 | **$297** | $1,200 | $1,200 | $1,800 | $300-3,000+ |
| Price Increases? | **Never** | Likely | Likely | Likely | API pricing varies |

**Kiyomi's Edge:** One payment, done. No monthly drain. No "we're raising prices" email. Kiyomi uses Gemini's free tier for 80% of tasks, so your ongoing cost is genuinely $0. Even with optional Claude API usage for complex tasks ($3-8/mo typical), you're paying a fraction of any subscription.

**Honest Note:** In the first year, ChatGPT and Claude Pro are technically cheaper ($240 vs $297). Kiyomi breaks even at month 15. After that, every month is pure savings. If you plan to use AI for more than 15 months (you will), Kiyomi wins.

### 🔧 Setup & Technical Difficulty

| | **Kiyomi** | **ChatGPT** | **Claude** | **Copilot** | **Clawdbot** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Setup Process | .dmg install | Sign up | Sign up | Microsoft account | CLI install + config |
| Time to First Use | 5 min | 2 min | 2 min | 5 min | 30-120 min |
| Terminal Required | **Never** | Never | Never | Never | **Always** |
| Configuration Files | **None** | None | None | Minimal | Extensive |
| API Keys Needed | **None** | None | None | None | Yes (multiple) |
| Documentation Needed | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal | Some | Significant |

**Kiyomi's Edge:** SaaS products are slightly faster to "set up" (it's just a login), but they require zero ownership. Kiyomi gives you the same ease of a consumer app while running locally. Compared to Clawdbot, it's night and day — Kiyomi is the Mac to Clawdbot's Linux.

**Honest Note:** ChatGPT and Claude are technically faster to start (just make an account). But Kiyomi's 5-minute setup gives you something they never will: ownership, privacy, and zero ongoing costs.

### 🔒 Privacy & Data Security

| | **Kiyomi** | **ChatGPT** | **Claude** | **Copilot** | **Clawdbot** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Where Data Lives | **Your Mac** | OpenAI servers | Anthropic servers | Microsoft servers | **Your machine** |
| Data Used for Training | **Never** | Opt-out available | Opt-out available | Unclear | **Never** |
| Conversations Accessible by Company | **No** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** |
| Data Breach Risk | **Your security** | Company breach risk | Company breach risk | Company breach risk | **Your security** |
| HIPAA/Compliance Friendly | **Yes** | Paid tiers only | Paid tiers only | Enterprise only | **Yes** |
| Can Delete All Data | **Yes (your files)** | Request required | Request required | Request required | **Yes (your files)** |
| Third-Party Data Sharing | **None** | Per privacy policy | Per privacy policy | Per privacy policy | **None** |

**Kiyomi's Edge:** This is Kiyomi's strongest category. Your conversations, memories, documents — everything stays on your Mac. Not on a server. Not in a training dataset. Not in the next data breach headline. For lawyers, therapists, medical professionals, financial advisors — this isn't a feature, it's a requirement.

**Honest Note:** Kiyomi does send prompts to Gemini/Claude APIs for processing (the AI models are cloud-based). But your persistent data, memory files, and conversation history never leave your machine. The API calls are stateless — Google/Anthropic don't retain them under their API terms of service.

### 🧠 Memory & Context

| | **Kiyomi** | **ChatGPT** | **Claude** | **Copilot** | **Clawdbot** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Persistent Memory | **Full system** | Limited (Memory feature) | Limited (Projects) | Minimal | **Full system** |
| Learns Preferences | **Yes, permanently** | Partially | Partially | Barely | **Yes, permanently** |
| Cross-Session Context | **Complete** | Partial | Partial (Projects) | Minimal | **Complete** |
| Memory is User-Editable | **Yes (plain files)** | Limited | Limited | No | **Yes (plain files)** |
| Memory Survives Account Changes | **Yes (it's your files)** | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Industry-Specific Context | **Pre-loaded via templates** | Manual setup | Manual setup | Some | Manual setup |
| Knows Your Clients/Projects | **Yes, after you tell it** | Forgets often | Project-scoped | No | **Yes** |

**Kiyomi's Edge:** This is where the "assistant" part of "AI assistant" actually means something. Tell Kiyomi your brand voice on day 1. It knows it on day 365. Tell it your top client's name. It never asks again. The Skills + Memory system stores everything in plain text files on your Mac — you can read them, edit them, back them up. ChatGPT's memory is a black box that sometimes works. Kiyomi's memory is your file system.

**Honest Note:** ChatGPT's Memory feature has improved recently, and Claude's Projects offer good session-level context. But neither matches the depth and permanence of Kiyomi's file-based memory system, which persists indefinitely and is fully transparent.

### 🎨 Customization & Flexibility

| | **Kiyomi** | **ChatGPT** | **Claude** | **Copilot** | **Clawdbot** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Custom Workflows | **Skills system** | GPTs (limited) | Projects (limited) | Power Automate | **Unlimited** |
| Industry Templates | **5 built-in** | GPT store | None built-in | Some | **None (DIY)** |
| Custom UI | **Cockpit (beautiful)** | Fixed web UI | Fixed web UI | Fixed UI | **Terminal** |
| Quick Action Buttons | **Yes** | No | No | Limited | **No** |
| Model Selection | **Multi-model auto** | GPT-4 only | Claude only | GPT-4/various | **Any model** |
| Telegram Integration | **Native** | No | No | No | **Configurable** |
| Extensible | **Via Skills** | Via plugins | Limited | Via Graph API | **Fully** |

**Kiyomi's Edge:** Kiyomi hits the sweet spot between "no customization" (ChatGPT) and "infinite customization if you're an engineer" (Clawdbot). The vertical templates mean you start with a working setup for your industry. The Skills system lets you add capabilities without code. And the Cockpit gives you a GUI that's actually beautiful — not a terminal window.

**Honest Note:** Clawdbot is technically more flexible — it's open-source and you can modify anything. But that flexibility requires engineering knowledge. ChatGPT's GPT store offers some customization, but it's surface-level compared to Kiyomi's Skills + Memory system.

### 📡 Offline & Reliability

| | **Kiyomi** | **ChatGPT** | **Claude** | **Copilot** | **Clawdbot** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Works Without Internet | **Partial** (memory/UI) | No | No | No | **Partial** |
| Affected by Service Outages | **Minimal** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Minimal** |
| Rate Limiting | **Gemini free limits** | Plan limits | Plan limits | Plan limits | **API limits** |
| "High Demand" Throttling | **No** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** |
| Your Data Available Offline | **Always** | No | No | No | **Always** |
| Requires Account Login | **No** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** |

**Kiyomi's Edge:** When ChatGPT goes down (and it does, regularly), you lose access to everything. When Kiyomi's AI model is temporarily unavailable, you still have your Cockpit, your memory files, your conversation history — all accessible locally. The AI processing needs internet (Gemini API), but your data and interface never go away.

**Honest Note:** Kiyomi is not fully offline — the AI inference requires an internet connection to reach Gemini/Claude APIs. True local LLMs (like Ollama) run completely offline but require significant hardware and setup. Kiyomi's approach is a practical middle ground: local data + cloud AI.

### 📊 Learning Curve

| | **Kiyomi** | **ChatGPT** | **Claude** | **Copilot** | **Clawdbot** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| First 5 Minutes | Productive | Productive | Productive | Productive | Reading docs |
| First Week | Comfortable | Comfortable | Comfortable | Comfortable | Still configuring |
| "Power User" Time | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 weeks | 2-4 weeks | 1-3 months |
| Non-Technical Friendly | **Excellent** | Excellent | Excellent | Good | **Poor** |
| Requires Prompt Engineering | **Less (templates help)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Documentation Quality | Good | Good | Good | Extensive | Moderate |

**Kiyomi's Edge:** Kiyomi matches the ease of SaaS chatbots for getting started, but the vertical templates reduce the learning curve further — you don't need to learn prompt engineering when the prompts are already built for your industry. Compared to Clawdbot, which requires terminal literacy and manual configuration, Kiyomi is accessible to anyone who can install a Mac app.
